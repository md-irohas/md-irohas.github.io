## Summary

In late March 2024, I took about two weeks off and went on a road trip through
the San'in region and down into Kyushu.
All in all, I drove around 3,000 kilometers.
It was pretty exhausting physically, but I made it back home safely.

The first half of the trip was spent exploring the San'in region.
Even though it was early spring, the weather on the Sea of Japan side was rough
-- with strong winds and snowstorms -- so getting around wasn't easy.
Still, I managed to visit some iconic spots like the Tottori Sand Dunes and
Izumo Taisha Shrine.

In the second half, I crossed over to Kyushu and drove along the Milk Road
around Mount Aso.
That stretch of road, winding along the outer rim of the Aso caldera, was
absolutely amazing.

There were quite a few places I couldn't visit this time due to time
constraints, so I'm already thinking about planning another trip.

Even though it was late March, I encountered a snowstorm on the mountain roads.
I followed behind a snowplow and managed to arrive safely in Tottori.

Due to the snowstorm at the Tottori Sand Dunes, I stayed overnight in the city
and walked around the dunes the following day. <br><br>

I took a walk along Mizuki Shigeru Road.<br><br>

The hotel in front of the Sakaiminato Station, part of the Dormy Inn chain, was
reasonably priced, had a traditional Japanese style, and even featured a hot
spring on the top floor.
It was excellent. <br><br>

I visited Izumo Taisha, Izumo Hinomisaki Lighthouse, and Inasanohama Beach.
Izumo Taisha was very crowded, so I couldn't take any photos for a blog post.

I had planned to visit Tsunoshima Lighthouse and Tsunoshima Bridge along the
way, but due to heavy wind and rain, sightseeing wasn't possible, so I moved on
quickly.
