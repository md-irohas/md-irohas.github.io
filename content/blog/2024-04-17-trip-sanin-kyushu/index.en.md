## Summary

In late March 2024, I took advantage of a two-week vacation to go on a road
trip through the San'in and Kyushu regions of Japan.
The total distance I covered was around 3,000 kilometers.
While the trip was physically demanding, it was also incredibly fulfilling.

During the first half of the journey, I traveled through the San'in region.
Although it was early spring, the weather along the Sea of Japan was rough,
and some highways were still incomplete, which made getting around a bit challenging.
Still, I was able to visit iconic spots like the Tottori Sand Dunes and Izumo Taisha,
and truly experience the charm of the San'in area.

In the second half of the trip, I crossed over to Kyushu and visited Mount Aso.
Unfortunately, I started feeling unwell while I was there,
so I decided to cut the trip short and return quickly to my home in Tokyo.

There are still many places I wasn’t able to visit this time due to time constraints,
so I hope to set out on another journey to explore them in the near future.

Even though it was late March, I encountered a snowstorm on the mountain roads.
I followed behind a snowplow and managed to arrive safely in Tottori.

I took a walk along Mizuki Shigeru Road.<br><br>

The hotel in front of the Sakaiminato Station, part of the Dormy Inn chain, was
reasonably priced, had a traditional Japanese style, and even featured a hot
spring on the top floor.
It was excellent.<br><br>
