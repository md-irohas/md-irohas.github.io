## Story

In March 2025, I stayed one night at a campsite called Camp Resort
Oshima while traveling along the coastline of Wakayama Prefecture.

Camp Resort Oshima is located on a small island just off Cape Shionomisaki, the southernmost point of Japan's main island, Honshu.
While planning my route through Wakayama, I happened to discover that there was
a campsite on the island next to the cape -- and I thought, why not go for a
solo camping trip there?

Wakayama... is too big.

The campsite sits on a hill with an ocean view.
Like Cape Shionomisaki, the land ends here -- beyond it lies nothing but the
vast Pacific Ocean.
With no man-made obstructions in sight, it's an incredibly open and freeing
location.

There's also a small open-air bath on the grounds.
From the tub, you get a sweeping view of the Pacific, beyond steep cliffs.
It's truly a spectacular view.

The wind was strong that day, and I struggled a bit with cooking since the
flames wouldn't catch well.
But at night, the sky was filled with stars.

It's quite far from Tokyo, but I'd love to come back someday and take my time
here again.
