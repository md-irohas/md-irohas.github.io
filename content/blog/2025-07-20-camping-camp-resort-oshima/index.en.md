## Sumamry

In March 2025, I stayed one night at a campsite called Nanki Kushimoto Resort
Oshima while traveling along the coastline of Wakayama Prefecture.

Nanki Kushimoto Resort Oshima is located on a small island just off Cape
Shionomisaki, the southernmost point of Japan's main island, Honshu.
While planning my route through Wakayama, I happened to discover that there was
a campsite on the island next to the cape -- and I thought, why not go for a
solo camping trip there?

Wakayama... is big.

The campsite sits on a hill with an ocean view.
Like Cape Shionomisaki, the land ends here -- beyond it lies nothing but the
vast Pacific Ocean.
With no man-made obstructions in sight, it's an incredibly open and freeing
location.

There's also a small open-air bath on the grounds.
From the tub, you get a sweeping view of the Pacific, beyond steep cliffs.
It's truly a spectacular view.

The wind was strong that day, and I struggled a bit with cooking since the
flames wouldn't catch well.
But at night, the sky was filled with stars, and I found myself quietly staring
up at them, lost in thought.

It's quite far from Tokyo, but I'd love to come back someday and take my time
here again.
