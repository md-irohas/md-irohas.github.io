## Sumamry

In March 2025, after visiting Ise Shrine, I drove along the Iseshima Skyline.

The Iseshima Skyline is a toll road about 16 kilometers long that connects Ise and Toba.
It winds over Mount Asama, which stands at around 500 meters above sea level, and is often called a "sky-high drive" for its stunning views.
Along the route, there are scenic overlooks and the Asamayama Kongosho-ji Temple, making it a popular sightseeing road.

Every viewpoint along the way offered spectacular scenery,
but the summit observation area was particularly impressive.
There, you'll find a foot bath with a panoramic view of Ise Bay and the "Sky Postbox,"
which stands out vividly against the blue sky.
I also stopped by Kongosho-ji Temple on the way.
In contrast to the busy observation points,
the temple grounds were quiet and serene, with a solemn atmosphere.

I couldn't get any decent photos at Ise Shrine because of the crowds,
but Konggsho-ji was almost empty, which allowed me to fully enjoy the temple in peace.

The toll for the Iseshima Skyline was ¥1,270 for a standard car (as of March 2025),
which felt a bit pricey at first.
But after actually driving it,
I felt it was well worth it -- for the views, the temple visit, and the refreshing drive along the mountain ridgeline.

If you're planning a visit to the Ise Shrine,
I highly recommend adding the Iseshima Skyline to your itinerary.

Just a heads-up: even on a weekday morning, the Ise Shrine was incredibly crowded.
