## Story

At the end of July 2025, I went on a short summer getaway, visiting Kiyosato Terrace in Yamanashi Prefecture, Yashimagahara Wetland and Utsukushigahara Highlands in Nagano Prefecture.

### Kiyosato Terrace

My first stop was Sun Meadows Kiyosato -- Kiyosato Terrace in Yamanashi Prefecture.

Sun Meadows Kiyosato is an outdoor resort located near the Yamanashi‚ÄìNagano border.  
In winter, it operates as a ski resort, but in summer, part of the area is open as a cool summer retreat.
The Panorama Area, reached by lift, sits at 1,900 meters above sea level, offering refreshing weather even in midsummer.

I parked in the resort lot, walked to the Center House, and bought a round-trip lift ticket for 2,800 yen per adult. 

Passing through the Center House, I stepped out onto ski slopes now covered in lush summer greenery.

To reach the Panorama Area at the top, I took the Panorama Lift.

    caption="Panorama Lift (going up)"
    class="w50"
    >}}


The lift stopped twice on the way, but only briefly,
as it seemed to pause for wheelchair users or pets getting on and off.
After about ten minutes, I arrived at the Panorama Area.

The view from the top was as spectacular as promised -- clouds floating at eye level created a truly memorable scene.

The Panorama Area features large sofas where visitors can lounge freely,
and a cafe next to it where I enjoyed some gelato.

    >}}


From the cafe area, a staircase leads up to an observation deck at an even higher elevation.
On a clear day, Mt. Fuji can be seen from there.
Unfortunately, I couldn't spot Fuji that day,
but the view still stretched far into the distance.

For the return trip, I took the same lift back down.

Back at the Center House, it was lunchtime,
so I had curry rice at the restaurant there.
Even at midday in summer, the temperature was just 23¬∞C with a refreshing highland breeze.
The curry rice, eaten on the terrace, tasted especially good in the cool air.

When I was exploring, the skies over Kiyosato Terrace were sunny, though I could hear thunder in the distance.
Since mountain weather can change quickly, it's worth being prepared for sudden shifts.


### Yashimagahara Wetland

Next, I drove local roads from Kiyosato to Yashimagahara Wetland.

{{< google-maps-2

  >}}


Yashimagahara Weland, located in Nagano Prefecture at about 1,600 meters elevation, is a well-known spot for nature observation and hiking.

I parked at the visitor center next to the wetland and headed toward the entrance.

    alt="IMG_3517.jpg"
    caption="Signboard of Yashimagahara Wetland"
    class="w50"
    >}}


A full loop around the wetland takes about 90 minutes,
but a sudden sun shower caught me,
so this time I only viewed the wetland from the entrance before turning back.

### Roadside Station: Utsukushigahara Kogen

Leaving Yashimagahara, I drove along the Venus Line to the Utsukushigahara Highlands.

{{< google-maps-2
  url="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d205973.76370237506!2d137.97505568788443!3d36.23123247241489!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x601da98f6014a045%3A0x35129f6217ffcd58!2sRoadside%20Station%20Utsukushigahara%20Kogen%20Parking%20Lot!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sjp!4v1758275969698!5m2!1sen!2sjp"
  >}}


The Utsukushigahara Highlands span parts of Matsumoto and Ueda in Nagano.
The area offers pastures, walking trails, a museum, and a roadside station.

I had planned to walk one of the trails,
but since it was raining, I headed straight to the roadside station.
There, I enjoyed the scenery of sunlight and rain mixing over the landscape.

    alt="IMG_3526.jpg"
    caption="Panoramic view from Utsukushigahara Kogen"
    class="w100"
    >}}


All the places I visited on this trip were at elevations of 1,500‚Äì2,000 meters, keeping them pleasantly cool even in midsummer.
Unfortunately, the rain meant I couldn't explore the boardwalks at Yashimagahara or visit the Utsukushi-no-tou Tower and the art museum in Utsukushigahara.
I hope to return another time to enjoy them.
