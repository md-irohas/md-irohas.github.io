## Story

In July 2023, I visited Kashima Jingu in Ibaraki Prefecture.

Kashima Jingu is known as one of Japan's oldest shrines.
It enshrines [Takemikazuchi-no-Okami (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takemikazuchi), a deity associated with martial strength.

I drove there, and the area near the entrance felt a bit tense with people trying hard to guide cars into their parking lots.
There is an official parking lot closer to the torii gate (further in), so I parked there and visited the shrine from that side.

The area near the entrance had a typical touristy vibe, but once inside the grounds it became quiet.
The inner approach leading toward the Okumiya (Inner Shrine) is surrounded by tall trees and feels like a world apart.

On the way along the Okusando, there is a sazare-ishi.
You might recognize the term from Japan's national anthem, "Kimigayo"; it literally means "small stones".
Since it connects to both the anthem and religious context, if you're curious, take a look at [Wikipedia (Japanese only)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%95%E3%81%96%E3%82%8C%E7%9F%B3).

Deeper inside, there is Mitarai Pond, fed by spring water.
It's calm and understated in person, but it turns into a great photo spot when you bump up the saturation a little.
