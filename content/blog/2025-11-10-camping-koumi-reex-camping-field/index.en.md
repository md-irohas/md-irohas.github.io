## Story

In September 2023, I spent one night at Koumi Reex Camping Field (now Chateraise Camp Resort Koumi) in Nagano Prefecture.

Chateraise Camp Resort Koumi is a highland resort run by Chateraise at the foot of Mount Yatsugatake in Nagano Prefecture.
In winter it mainly operates as a ski area, while in summer the area also opens as a campground.

Because I stayed on a weekday,
the plot I reserved was practically private -- there were no other campers in the neighboring sites.

After setting up my tent I went to the nearby hot spring "Hoshizora-no-Yu Reex".
The view from the open-air bath was wonderful, and after the bath I got a free Chateraise ice cream afterward.

That night I could see a beautiful starry sky from the campsite, although distant thunder was rumbling.

However, there seemed to be many deer or similar animals in the bushes around the camping area;
their glowing eyes moved around in the dark, and it felt like they were watching me, which was a bit unnerving
