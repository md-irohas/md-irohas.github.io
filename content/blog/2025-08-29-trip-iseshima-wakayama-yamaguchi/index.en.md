## Story

In March 2025, just like last year,
I took about two weeks off and went on a road trip through Mie, Wakayama, Nagasaki, and Yamaguchi prefectures.

{{< google-maps-2
    url="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1DyBsZw6VKng0PUMfvncx8UBHwofmsa4&ehbc=2E312F&noprof=1"
    width="100%"
    >}}

The total distance traveled was about 3,500 km.
This year, I tried some new things, such as taking a ferry for part of the journey and staying at campgrounds.
I visited places like Ise-Shima in Mie, Nachi Taisha and Shionomisaki in Wakayama, Nagasaki Peninsula, and Akiyoshido in Yamaguchi.

It was a physically demanding trip again this year,
but I was able to see many landscapes I had never seen before,
making it a very satisfying journey.


## Timeline

This trip lasted 11 days, with a total distance of about 3,500 km.

Here is the timeline and the spots I visited during the trip.


{{< timeline >}}

{{< timelineItem
    header="Day 1: Tokyo (Home) ‚Üí Ise City"
    icon="car-front-fill" >}}

On the 1st day, I left my home in Tokyo and headed to my first destination, Ise City in Mie Prefecture. 
<br>

{{< google-maps-2
    url="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1qczpuR47L_xcTsWJnNCqgeWkMSUbAes&ehbc=2E312F&noprof=1"
    width="480"
    height="320"
    >}}

I arrived in Ise City before sunset,
so I dropped off my luggage at the hotel and went to a nearby hot spring to relax.

    >}}

{{< /timelineItem >}}


{{< timelineItem
    header="Day 2: Ise Jingu & Ise-Shima Sightseeing"
    icon="geo-alt-fill" 
    >}}

On the 2nd day, I toured Ise Jingu and the Ise-Shima area.

<br>

{{< google-maps-2
    url="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1tx_mDE7gAFlw5Xy2YDaPN77qXKOVX9M&ehbc=2E312F&noprof=1"
    width="480"
    height="360"
    >}}

The Ise and Ise-Shima area is much larger than I expected, with many tourist spots.
If you want to take your time sightseeing, it's best to allow plenty of days.

{{< /timelineItem >}}


{{< timelineItem
    header="Day 2-1: Ise Jingu"
    icon="camera-fill"
    >}}

I visited both the Outer Shrine and Inner Shrine of Ise Jingu.

<ul>
    <li>Ise Jingu: <a href="https://www.isejingu.or.jp/en/" target="_blank">https://www.isejingu.or.jp/en/</a></li>
</ul>

As expected, Ise Jingu was very crowded even on a weekday.
It was hard to take photos without people in them,
so I don't have many pictures to share.

{{< figure
    src="IMG_3115.jpg"
    alt="IMG_3115.jpg"
    caption="Ise Jingu Inner Shrine"
    class="w50"
    >}}

On the way back from the shrine,
I had zenzai (sweet red bean soup) at the Akafuku.
It had been a while since I had sweet red bean paste, and it was delicious.
I thought about buying Akafuku mochi as a souvenir,
but the shelf life was short (only two days?), so I gave up.

<ul>
    <li>Akafuku: <a href="https://www.akafuku.co.jp/en/" target="_blank">https://www.akafuku.co.jp/en/</a></li>
</ul>

{{< figure
    src="IMG_3119.jpg"
    alt="IMG_3119.jpg"
    caption="Akafuku Zenzai"
    class="w50"
    >}}

I went early on a weekday morning, but the parking lot at the Inner Shrine was almost full.
I parked a bit farther away, but even that lot had a line of cars waiting when I left.
If you plan to visit by car, be careful about parking.

{{< timelineItem
    header="Day 2-2: Iseshima Skyline"
    icon="camera-fill"
    >}}

After visiting Ise Jingu, I drove along the Iseshima Skyline.

<br>
<br>

The feeling of driving along the mountain ridges,
the breathtaking views from the observatory,
and the solemn Kongoshoji Temple were all wonderful experiences.

<br>
<br>

{{< article link="/blog/2025-03-15-tripphoto-iseshima-skyline/" >}}

{{< /timelineItem >}}


{{< timelineItem
    header="Day 2-3: Iseshima"
    icon="camera-fill"
    >}}

After driving the Iseshima Skyline, I took the Pearl Road toward Iseshima.

<br>
<br>

I stopped at the Toba Observatory and had lunch at the cafe there.
The ocean view from the cafe was spectacular.

<br>

    class="w50"
    >}}

After eating and taking a short break, I headed to the Yokoyama Observatory.

<br>
<br>

{{< article link="/blog/2025-03-18-tripphoto-iseshima/" >}}

<br>

After sightseeing, I went to the same hot spring as the first day and relaxed.

{{< timelineItem
    header="Day 3: Ise City, Mie ‚Üí Kushimoto Town, Wakayama"
    icon="car-front-fill"
    >}}

On the 3rd day, I aimed for Kushimoto Town,
the southernmost point of Honshu, starting from Ise City.

<br>

{{< google-maps-2
    url="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1RCMRD0C1eGMJDb4OPpEQh41eGac8B5w&ehbc=2E312F&noprof=1"
    width="480"
    height="360"
    >}}

I stopped by the Umigame (Sea Turtle) Aquarium, Kumano Nachi Taisha, and Nachi Falls,
then enjoyed Shionomisaki, the southernmost tip of Honshu, and the Shionomisaki Lighthouse, before heading to the campground for the night.

<br>
<br>

Wakayama was much bigger than I expected...

{{< /timelineItem >}}


{{< timelineItem
    header="Day 3-1: Umigame (Sea Turtle) Aquarium"
    icon="camera-fill"
    >}}

I stopped by the Umigame Aquarium in Kiho Town, Mie Prefecture.

<ul>
    <li>Umigame Aquarium: <a href="https://umigame.info/" target="_blank">https://umigame.info/</a></li>
</ul>

{{< google-maps-2

The Umigame Aquarium is a small, free aquarium attached to the Kiho Town Umigame Park roadside station, where they work to protect sea turtles and raise awareness.

    alt="IMG_3172.jpg"
    caption="Kiho Town Umigame Park"

Inside the building, various turtles of different sizes are kept,
and you can see many turtles up close that you wouldn't normally encounter.

They also post photos and videos of turtles on social media like X (formerly Twitter),
so if you're interested, follow them for some healing content üê¢üê¢üê¢

After visiting the Umigame Park,
I continued south and visited Kumano Nachi Taisha and Nachi Falls.

<br>

After visiting Kumano Nachi Taisha,
I headed to Shionomisaki, the southernmost tip of Honshu, and the Shionomisaki Lighthouse.

<br>
<br>

{{< timelineItem

On the third night, I stayed at a campground on Kii Oshima, next to Shionomisaki, the southernmost tip of Honshu.

<br>
<br>

{{< timelineItem
    header="Day 4: Kushimoto Town, Wakayama ‚Üí Iyo City, Ehime"
    icon="car-front-fill"
    >}}

The 4th day was mostly a travel day,
moving from Kushimoto Town at the southern tip of Wakayama to Iyo City in western Shikoku.

<br>
<br>

The distance was about 500 km, taking 7 hours even without stops.

<br>

{{< google-maps-2

    height="360"
    >}}

Most of the day was spent driving, with the only sightseeing break at the Awaji Service Area to view the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge.

{{< figure

    alt="IMG_3258.jpg"
    caption="Akashi Kaikyo Bridge"
    class="w50"
    >}}

I arrived in Iyo City in the evening and had dinner at a local ramen chain in a shopping mall.

{{< timelineItem
    header="Day 5: Iyo City, Ehime ‚Üí Nagasaki City, Nagasaki"

On the 5th day, I headed from Iyo City to Nagasaki City in Nagasaki Prefecture.

<br>

{{< google-maps-2

    height="360"
    >}}

Heading west from Iyo City along the Sadamisaki Peninsula,
I found the Ikata Nuclear Power Plant operated by Shikoku Electric Power.
Next to the plant is a roadside station and the Ikata Visitors' House,
where you can see free exhibits and explanations about nuclear power generation.

    caption="Exhibits at Ikata Visitors' House"
    class="w50"

Continuing west, I took the ferry from the Route 94 Ferry Misaki Office to Oita.

A sea journey is nice once in a while.

    caption="From the ferry deck"

In Oita, I stopped by Beppu Onsen, enjoyed the hot springs and a relaxing meal, then headed to Nagasaki.
 Beppu Onsen was very crowded even on a weekday...

    height="360"
    >}}

The only sightseeing spot on the way back was Akiyoshido Cave in Yamaguchi Prefecture,
and I drove straight toward Tokyo.
The Mekari Parking Area, where I stopped along the way, offered a great view of the Kanmon Straits.

<br>
<br>

{{< article link="/blog/2025-08-25-tripphoto-kanmon-straits/" >}}

<br>

After that, I visited Akiyoshido Cave and then traveled to Okayama for the night.

<br>
<br>

On the 11th day, I returned from Okayama City to Tokyo in one day.
I relaxed at a hot spring in Mie along the way.

<br>
