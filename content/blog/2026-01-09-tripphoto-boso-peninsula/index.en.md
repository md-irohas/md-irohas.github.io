## Story

In April 2023, I drove around the southern part of the Boso Peninsula.

{{< google-maps-2

  >}}


### Umihotaru

I started the trip at Umihotaru Parking Area.

Umihotaru is a parking area built on an artificial island in the middle of Tokyo Bay, along the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line.

{{< google-maps-2

  >}}


There are observation decks on both sides, and you can enjoy views that make you feel like you are right in the middle of Tokyo Bay.

### Mt. Nokogiri Nihon-ji Temple

From Umihotaru, I headed to Nihon-ji Temple on Mt. Nokogiri.

Nihon-ji Temple is a temple in Kyonan, Chiba Prefecture, and the temple grounds extend across the mountain.

- Nihon-ji Temple: https://www.nihonji.jp/

{{< google-maps-2

  >}}


I parked near the East Gate ticket office and entered from the gate.

Since the grounds are huge, I started by heading toward the summit area, taking my time to see the Great Buddha and stone statues along the way.

{{< figure

  caption="The Great Buddha at the Great Buddha Plaza"
  class="w50"
  >}}


The paths are well maintained, but getting around is basically hiking.
Even though it was April, I was sweating by the time I reached the summit area.

{{< alert icon="circle-info" >}}
Visiting Nihon-ji Temple involves hiking.
Wear comfortable clothes and shoes.
{{< /alert >}}

Near the observation deck at the top, I could see the famous Jigoku Nozoki ("Hell's Peek"), Tokyo Bay, and even Mt. Fuji in the distance.

  class="w50"

On the way down, I headed back through the Rakan area while looking at the stone statues.

It had a unique and slightly eerie vibe, like a strange little world of its own.

### Nagisa-no-Eki Tateyama

On the way from Nihon-ji Temple to Nojimazaki Lighthouse, I stopped by Nagisa-no-Eki Tateyama.

{{< google-maps-2
  url="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d209195.64153186363!2d139.8522238!3d34.9896318!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6017f73406dd2e2d%3A0x72b78652932f462e!2z5ria44Gu6aeF44Gf44Gm44KE44G-IOWxleacm-ODh-ODg-OCrQ!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sjp!4v1768207918165!5m2!1sen!2sjp"
  >}}


Nagisa-no-Eki Tateyama is a roadside station along the coast in Tateyama, Chiba.
Inside, there are exhibits of fish found in the nearby sea, and behind the building you can enjoy a wide-open view of the ocean.

When I visited, I could also see Mt. Fuji in the distance.

### Nojimazaki Lighthouse

After that, I headed to Nojimazaki Lighthouse.

Nojimazaki Lighthouse stands on Nojimazaki Cape, the southernmost point of the Boso Peninsula.
It was built in 1869.

{{< google-maps-2
  url="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d209427.4149637205!2d139.8883212!3d34.8988359!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6017e51902260c51%3A0x371d120ef52d2739!2sNojimazaki%20Lighthouse!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sjp!4v1768207633010!5m2!1sen!2sjp"
  >}}


There was a parking lot near the coast, so I parked there and walked to the lighthouse.

Normally you can go inside the lighthouse and climb to the top, but unfortunately it was closed on the day I visited.
So I took a walk around the back.

{{< figure
  src="DSC04994.jpg"
  alt="DSC04994.jpg"
  caption="Nojimazaki Lighthouse"
  class="w50"
  >}}


Along the path behind the lighthouse, there is a monument marking the southernmost point of the Boso Peninsula.

{{< figure

  caption="Monument marking the southernmost point of the Boso Peninsula"
  class="w33"
  >}}


Further along, there is a bench with a panoramic view of the Pacific Ocean.

  class="w100"

It's a great photo spot, but it's a little awkward to climb up to, so watch your step.

{{< figure
  src="IMG_2085.jpg"

  caption="Where the bench is located"
  class="w50"

On the way back, I had lunch at a restaurant nearby.

### Katsuura Undersea Park

From Nojimazaki Lighthouse, I drove to Katsuura Undersea Park.

Katsuura Undersea Park is an undersea observation facility along the coast in Katsuura, Chiba.
You walk along a pier to the Undersea Observatory Tower, where you can look through the windows to observe marine life below.

- Katsuura Undersea Park: https://www.katsuura.org/

{{< google-maps-2
  url="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d208829.42955330992!2d140.2850033!3d35.1326758!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x603d49404394e0ab%3A0xd22221b85886f6b3!2sKatsuura%20Marine%20Park!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sjp!4v1768207696033!5m2!1sen!2sjp"
  >}}

{{< figure

  alt="IMG_2088.jpg"
  caption="The observatory tower standing in the sea"
  class="w50"
  >}}


The last stretch goes through narrow residential streets, so it was a bit tricky to navigate.
Also, it was very windy that day and the visibility underwater was poor, so the admission fee was discounted.

After going down the spiral staircase to the lowest level, I could see schools of fish outside the windows.
Because the sea was rough, the water was moving a lot, and the fish looked like they were being pushed along as they swam.

I forgot to take photos here, so there are no pictures for this spot.

After that, I stopped by a hot spring and later had conveyor-belt sushi for dinner.

{{< figure

Then I drove back to Umihotaru and headed home.
