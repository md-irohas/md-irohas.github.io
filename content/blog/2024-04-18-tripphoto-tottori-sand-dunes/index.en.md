## Story

In late March 2024, while traveling through the San'in region, I made a stop at
the Tottori Sand Dunes.

The Tottori Sand Dunes, stretching 16 km east to west and 2.4 km north to south, are one of Japan's largest coastal sand dunes and are designated as a national natural monument.

Up until the day before, the Sea of Japan coast had been hit by blizzards and
strong winds.
But I got lucky -- right after I arrived, the clouds started to break up and there were even a few patches of blue sky.

It was still cold and windy, but I was able to walk around the dunes.

From a distance, the dunes looked smaller than I expected, but once I stepped
onto them, I realized just how huge they really are.

That feeling of trudging step by step through the soft sand, and the view of
the stormy Sea of Japan from the top of the dunes -- it all felt a bit surreal,
like stepping out of everyday life for a moment.
