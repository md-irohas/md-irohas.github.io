## Story

In August 2023, I drove along the Daibosatsu Line.

The Daibosatsu Line is the common name for Route 411, which runs from Tabayama Village in Yamanashi Prefecture to Koshu City.
It can be a fairly steep mountain road, but it is well maintained and features a loop bridge, which makes it a popular spot for touring.

On this trip I drove from the Tabayama side toward Koshu.

First, I headed to the Roadside Station Tabayama.

At the roadside station, there was a cafe serving game meat dishes, and I tried a venison burger there.

From behind the cafe, I could see what is called "Tabayama Castle" in the distance.
It's not an actual historical castle, but rather a tourist facility;
apparently it is the starting point for a roller slide that is said to be the longest in Japan.

Tabayama Village is surrounded by deep mountains and has a quiet, calm atmosphere.

From the roadside station, I continued west.
After crossing the Yanagisawa Pass and descending, there is a loop bridge with a small parking area and a viewpoint.
Google Maps labels it as a "Mt. Fuji Viewpoint," though I couldn't find an official name.

From that viewpoint, I could see Mt. Fuji beyond the mountain ranges on the Koshu side.
It was a very natural, unspoiled view -- Mt. Fuji in the distance with almost no man-made objects in sight.

From there, I continued on to Koshu and then drove home on local roads.
