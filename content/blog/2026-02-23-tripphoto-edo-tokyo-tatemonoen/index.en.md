## Story

In February 2026, I visited the Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum.

The Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum is an outdoor museum inside Koganei Park in Koganei, Tokyo.
It features relocated and restored buildings from the Edo period to the mid-Showa era, including homes, shops, and public buildings.
You can actually walk inside many of them and see interiors and daily-life items up close.
Here, Edo refers to 1603-1868, Meiji to 1868-1912, and Showa to 1926-1989.

As of February 2026, admission was 400 yen for adults (200 yen for age 65+, 320 yen for university students, 200 yen for high school students, and free for junior high school students and younger).
Please check the official website for the latest details.

The museum grounds are divided into the West Zone, Center Zone, and East Zone,
so I walked through them in that order.

There are a lot of buildings, so this post focuses mostly on photos.
For detailed building information, please check the official website.


### West Zone

- Restored Buildings (West Zone): https://www.tatemonoen.jp/restore/intro/west.php

Denenchofu House (Okawa Residence).
This one-story house was built in Denenchofu in 1925, and all rooms are Western-style.

{{< figure

    caption="Denenchofu House: Entrance Toward Living Room"
    class="w33"

Maekawa Kunio Residence.
This Japanese-style residence was built in 1942 under wartime conditions.
I liked the airy open ceiling and the light coming in through the windows.

{{< figure
    src="DSC06674.jpg"
    alt="DSC06674.jpg"
    caption="Maekawa Residence: Living Room"
    class="w33"

    caption="Maekawa Residence: Portable TV in the Study (1)"
    class="w50"

    caption="Maekawa Residence: Open Ceiling in the Living Room"
    class="w50"
    >}}

{{< alert icon="circle-info" >}}
The TV in the study appears to be a Sony portable TV released in 1962.
It is impressive that Sony released a 5-inch compact TV back in 1962,
and also that the Sony logo has barely changed since then.

Koide Residence.

Tsunashima and Yoshino farmhouses.
The pillars and earthen floors gave me a strong sense of traditional farmhouse construction.

Maruni Shoten (housewares shop).
This general-goods shop was built in the early Showa era (early 20th century).

Takei Sanshodo (stationery store).
It was founded in the early Meiji era (late 19th century).
I liked the atmosphere created by the wall-to-wall shelves.

This residence belonged to a long-established family that held an important local role in what is now Ota Ward during the Edo period.

### Closing Notes

Seeing buildings and everyday tools from the Edo period through the Showa era at the Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum
made it a day that left me with a quiet sense of nostalgia.
The light and background probably change a lot by season, so I would like to visit again at a different time of year.

I was able to see the whole site in about three hours while taking photos.
Since you cover a fair amount of distance on foot and many buildings require removing shoes, comfortable shoes that are easy to slip on and off are helpful.

Many interiors are fairly dark, so a fast lens helps if you plan to take photos.
The indoor spaces are also quite narrow, so a wider lens was useful.

After the walk, I had abura soba (soupless ramen with sauce and oil) at nearby Ippei Soba before heading home.
The chashu (braised pork) was especially good.
